In this directory, you can see my experiments on different datasets to generate text. I tried with [work of Neitzsche](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/), Shakespease and [Dave Chappelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Chappelle). I tried to generate Standup Comedy Script by using Dave Chappelle's Netflix specials, but the results were not satisfactory. You can see the data in `Dave Chappelle` directory. Working on Character Level and Word Level text generation models.

### TODO
Also writing a script for generating text, from any given text file.
